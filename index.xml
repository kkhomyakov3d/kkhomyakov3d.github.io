      <description>As a follow-up to the previous post, here&amp;rsquo;re some open source ray/path tracers. Again, no particular order, CPU and GPU powered, static and real-time ones. May be useful for someone looking for even more graphics programming sources of inspiration :goberserk:
The list will be updated from time to time, any additions are welcome.

      <description>Here is a small collection of open source engines and helper libs related to real-time rendering I&amp;rsquo;ve found for self-learning purposes. No particular order, veterans of the industry mixed with hobby projects. May be useful for someone looking for graphics programming sources of inspiration :feelsgood:

      <description>My name is Konstantin Khomyakov. I am a gameplay/graphics engineer at Wargaming Moscow. Previously a developer of the WebGL engine Blend4Web.
I am passionate about everything related to computer graphics, performance, engine and game architecture.
This site is a blog with small notes and reminders I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful and want to share with the community.

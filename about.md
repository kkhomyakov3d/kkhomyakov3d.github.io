My name is Konstantin Khomyakov. I am a game/graphics engineer at Wargaming Moscow. A former developer of the WebGL engine [Blend4Web](https://www.blend4web.com/en/).

I am passionate about everything related to computer graphics, performance, engine and game architecture.

This site is a blog with small notes and reminders I've found useful and want to share with the community.

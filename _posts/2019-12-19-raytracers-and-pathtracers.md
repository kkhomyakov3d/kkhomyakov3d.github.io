title: Open-Source Ray Tracers and Path Tracers
---

As a follow-up to the [previous post](https://kkhomyakov3d.github.io/real-time-engines/), here're some open source ray/path tracers. Again, no particular order, CPU and GPU powered, static and real-time ones. May be useful for someone looking for even more graphics programming sources of inspiration :goberserk:

The list will be updated from time to time, any additions are welcome.
